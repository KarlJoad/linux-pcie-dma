*SINGLE BIG BAR REGION*
* BAR Region (MMIO'd)
  * Registers are memory regions which are offset from the start of the BAR
    1. RQ Head offset
    2. RQ Tail pointer
    3. Doorbell register
    4. Valid register
       - Not processing? -> Valid = 1
       - Host checks this, and if valid = 0, do not touch anything
       - If 1, host checks RQ Head offset and writes Physical Address
       - Increment head offset
       - "Ring doorbell" => 1
         + Tell card to start
         + FPGA writes valid = 0
    5. CQ Head
    6. CQ Tail
    7. Batch factor $k$
       - After k entries, card raises interrupt
       - CPU can reap entries from completion queue
  * Request Queue & Complete Queue
    - Circular Queue
    - "Ring Buffer"
    - Head and Tail pointers
    - Has a fixed size
  * Driver has a bunch of ~#define RQ_TAIL_REG 0x0~ to identify things
  * ~iowrite32(dev->mem + RQ_TAIL_REG)~
